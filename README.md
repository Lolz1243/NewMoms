Improved Access to Clinical and Mental Health Resources for Postpartum Women

## Problem
Postpartum depression (PPD) is a severe mental health illness experienced by women after childbirth. Currently, the standard for screening is the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), consisting of 10 questions asked infrequently pre- and post-pregnancy. However, not all women have the socioeconomic ability to access effective healthcare even after childbirth. The AMHCA states that the annual cost of untreated maternal depression in the US is $5.7 billion dollars.
 
## Solution
NewMoms is a mobile/web application that improves access to mental health and clinical resources for postpartum mothers by providing a system to consistently track pregnant and postpartum women's mental states via a short 3 question survey provided every few days. Regular data collection allows users to see their mental state in a linear, visual representation so that they can quickly detect changes and potential incidence of postpartum depression. The app will implement an incentive structure through gamification in which consistent usage rewards the user with coupons for childcare products from partnerships with sponsor companies. Additional app features include constant customer engagement through mental health and postpartum health resources, a clinic referral system, and an appointment tracker, all built using ReactJS and Google Cloud.
 
## Impact
The app format is effective for raising awareness about PPD and building a personalized health information interface for our user base. Additionally, the incentive structure is particularly applicable for low-income women, who would greatly benefit from coupons and health information that does not require in-person visits with clinicians. 
 
## Business Model
We plan to further look into secondary market reports as well as conducting our own primary research through voice of customer (VoC), focusing initially on implementing the app in rural clinics. This focus, along with the low-cost footprint, will make us eligible for altruistic funding such as angel investments, NGOs (Merck for Mothers), state funding (Medicaid/AHEC), and crowdfunding. This initial funding would aid in growing a significant user base. The next step would be to pursue partnerships with manufacturers for ads and coupons which would provide sustainable revenue for general app maintenance. 

In conclusion, NEWMOMS will be a tool where women can view their changing mental state in order to recognize downward trends in PPD before they become severe.
